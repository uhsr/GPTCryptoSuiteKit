# GPTCryptoSuiteKit

## Description



## Features

- Integrate GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate cryptographically secure random seeds based on user-defined entropy.
- Implement a modular architecture for pluggable symmetric encryption algorithms, including AES-256, ChaCha20, and Serpent.
- Provide a secure key derivation function (KDF) based on Argon2id with configurable memory and iteration parameters.
- Support digital signature generation and verification using ECDSA with the secp256k1 curve and EdDSA with Curve25519.
- Enable homomorphic encryption using the BFV scheme for secure computation on encrypted data.
- Generate verifiable random functions (VRFs) using the Elligator 2 algorithm for non-interactive proofs.
- Incorporate a hardware security module (HSM) interface using PKCS#11 for secure key storage and management.
- Implement zero-knowledge proofs using the zk-SNARKs protocol with Groth16 proving system for privacy-preserving authentication.
