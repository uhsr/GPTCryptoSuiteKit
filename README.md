# GPTCryptoSuiteKit

## Description

A Rust-based cryptocurrency trading bot leveraging reinforcement learning with a custom-built, high-frequency market simulator for enhanced backtesting and strategy optimization against real-time order book data via WebSocket streams.

## Features

- Implements homomorphic encryption schemes for secure GPT model parameter updates without decryption.
- Generates verifiable random functions (VRFs) to ensure fairness in GPT-driven content generation.
- Integrates with hardware security modules (HSMs) for secure key storage and cryptographic operations.
- Performs differential privacy analysis on GPT model outputs to mitigate data leakage risks.
- Utilizes zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to authenticate GPT model usage without revealing the input data.
- Supports secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocols for collaborative GPT model training.
- Provides a secure enclave environment for executing sensitive GPT model components.
- Verifies the integrity of GPT model weights using cryptographic hash functions and digital signatures.
